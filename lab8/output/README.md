Design patterns :

I used decorator pattern and composite pattern to implement the input mask. 

1) Decorator pattern was used to decorate the output of EXP and CreditCard Number output. Using the output of the existing classes, the newly decorator classes re-formatted the output to reflect the new required format. 

2) Composite pattern was used to display the components as discussed in the class.

3) I also used State Machine pattern, to reflect where the cursor is at the moment. if the cursor is at CVC code, it will show up on the screen.
